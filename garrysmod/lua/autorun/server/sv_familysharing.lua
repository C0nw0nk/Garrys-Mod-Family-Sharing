Info :
This script will make it very hard for users who you ban from your server to return or bypass their current/existing bans.
When you ban a user it will also ban the account that owns Garry's Mod / has family shared them the game.
Because of the way this script works you can guarantee when you ban someone they have to buy a new Garry's Mod to be able to return. (Keep wasting your money. I am sure Garry does not mind you making him richer.)
Depending on the settings you assign you may also ban users by IP too what will make it harder for the banned user to return.
